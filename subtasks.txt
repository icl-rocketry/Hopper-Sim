Not suspicious text file for me to organise my own thoughts and divide the task into manageable subtasks

Man I'm so useless

Dynamics
- Get actual numbers DONE
- Make sure dynamics are actually correct
    - I think the dynamics are correct, just that I have really wonky maths (i.e. Thrust instantly becomes 0 after fuel depletion -> causes thing to spin)

FOR FUTURE (HOP SCRIPT)

- Implement flight into 3 phases (Ascent, Hover, Descent)

- The hopper will go up 8mm because initial thrust is 1500N -> need to simulate ascent phase

solver -> state -> phase of flight -> new force vector
                   -- Controller --

ASCENT 
- Max thrust up to 25 m
- Then decelerate to 50 m steadily
- Controlled States: Angles?

HOVER 
- Hover at steady altitude (50 m)
- Controlled States: ???
- Need thrust

DESCENT 
- Less thrust


Control System
- Controllability Check DONE
- Observability Check NOT DONE
- Have a controller for each phase -> each should control different states?
- Q matrix tuning


External Disturbances
- Add external disturbances and then pass through Kalman Filter to simulate sensor data
